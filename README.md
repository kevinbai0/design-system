# Design Project

This project consists of two components: design-system & design-ui.

The design-system is a combination of a simplified set of layout tools + a design tool.

The design-ui is a UI/UX design tool that writes front-end code. The goal of this tool is for the UX to be comparable to tools such as Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, and Framer. The generated code is written in a way so that there is a clear separation between the logic and the UI.

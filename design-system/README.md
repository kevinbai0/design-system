# Design System

A design system, built on top of styled-components and draws inspiration from styled-system.

This design system extends past theming and consistent components. It implements a new layout engine that converted into CSS. The purpose of this layout engine is to be simple, easy to reason with, and easy to be autogenerated with logical rules. Additionally, it's purpose is to be able to powerfully generate declarative layouts that are completely fluid and responsive.

In this design-system, the simplest building blocks are called a `Box`. For clarity, in HTML, it is simply a `div`.

## Concepts

In 99% of the user interfaces we build, we can break down the layout of our user interface down into a few simple relationships: position, size, and layout.

### Position

Position refers to the positioning of a Box on the screen (the x, y coordinates). There should only exist 2 ways: absolute positioning and relative positioning. These are the same two CSS positioning properties.

Absolute positioning refers to specifying an x,y coordinate. The Box will be placed at that x,y coordinate regardless of where everything else is.

Relative positioning means that the Box will not control its own x,y coordinates. It will simply let its parent control where on the screen it is positioned.

CSS positioning properties such as fixed and sticky aren't quite needed. With the scroll model from this design-system, fixed and sticky properties can be done just relative and absolute positioning.

### Layout

Every Box defines some sort of layout. The nice thing is that there are only two types of layout: Rows and Columns. Although seemingly over simplified, with some additional configuration options & nesting Boxes, rows and columns can powerfully express the layout of any user interface.

### Size

Size is a tricky parameter. Although the only 2 properties of size are width and height, there are three different ways size can be calculated.

1. Size can be calculated from its children's size.
2. A Box can provide its own size
3. Its parent can define the size of the child through layout

It gets complicated when the size is dependent on more than one of the above points. For example, a box which is going to let its children determine the size, but also has a maximum size that it can't go over is tricky to layout, especially when considering responsivity.
